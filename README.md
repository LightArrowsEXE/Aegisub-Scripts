# LightArrowsEXE's Aegisub Scripts

Simple automation scripts for Aegisub.
This will primarily be stuff
I wrote for myself,
and almost entirely KFX-focused.

# Required modules

None!

# Libraries

These should be placed
in your Aegisub automation directory
under `include/lightarrowsexe/*`.

## Animations

A collection of animation frames,
mainly aimed at
being a quick way
to get fancy drawings
for KFX.

### Usage

Drawings are stored in arrays of strings.
You can iterate through them
using for example
the following code snippet:

```lua
-- TODO: Add example using 0x's util.fbf and karaOK's loop functions
```

For a full list of drawings,
please refer to the library's [documentation](/modules/lightarrowsexe/animations/README.md).
